    <h2>Why WeAmity?</h2>
    <h3>For Students</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Projects – While during our academic period the importance of working on meaningful projects is very high in order to build a job-worthy resume. But every innovative project needs a diverse team of members from different skillsets.</li>
    <li>Internships – Either gaining an exposure of professional environment or learning new skills it is important for every student to go through various internships during academic breaks and vacations to get some real world training.</li>
    <li>Part-Time Earnings – Financial freedom is something which everyone one of us seek for but it is important to earn through a work which is related to our own academic curriculum.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For Start-ups</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Skilled contributors – Every start-up in its early stage need some contributors to work for it in order to fill the skill gap.</li>
    <li>Trust worthy allies – During its early stage when start-ups gather some low-skilled employees to train them and extract the return value afterwards usually employees switch companies as soon as they acquire substantial skills & employment period.</li>
    <li>Contributors on reasonable cost – Budget is the major issue of every early stage college start-up. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    WeAmity resolve these challenges by creating an ecosystem where start-ups can collaborate with the students on an inter-university online platform.
